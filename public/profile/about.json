    "about": "Hello Everyone,\n This webpage has all the information about me that you will need to hire me!\n\nI am a hardworking and an honest individual. Always eager to explore new things, both personally and professionally. I completed my undergraduate degree in computer science and started working as a Software Engineer Trainee. I worked as a full-stack developer for 1 year. Throughout my undergraduate studies, I was always interested in data science but had little exposure. Therefore, I decided to pursue my master's in Data Science to upskill and work in a field that interests me.\n\nI am also a very fun person to hang around with. I love to travel and trek. During my free-time I dance, paint and doodle. I also love to engage and talk to new people.",
